Template for building Haxe PHP projects with Haxe and Grunt 

Includes unit testing config (grunt runs tests by default use *grunt build* to build)

This is because I'm using ST2 and https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-grunt-build with build_on_save enabled, you'll get test results on each file save.
